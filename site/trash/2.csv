This background paper seeks to stimulate greater consideration of conflict risk and a more constructive path for project finance backed investments in conflict-prone regions.; While there is a cluster of factors that point to project financiers' particular exposure to conflict risk the project finance community is at the same time well-placed to take remedial steps to both protect their own investments and ensure that their business is not impacting negatively on those affected by violent conflict or the wider objectives of their own institutions.; The paper concludes that a conflict-sensitive approach to project finance requires financial institutions and other actors to understand the conflict context in which a project is developed. In addition they must recognise the interactions between the project activities and that context; and from there act to prevent any negative impacts that may be the result of that interaction.; [Summary Source: International Alert Eldis],http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/Conflict_Project_Finance_0.pdf,,,Conflict_Project_Finance.pdf

The potential of these multiple efforts is not fully realized. Practitioners know that so long as people continue to suffer the consequences of unresolved conflicts there is urgency for everyone to do better.; So in spite of the real limitations and constraints the question of effectiveness is high on the agenda of peace practitioners. It is posed in several ways: How do we do what we do better with more effect with better effect? How do we know that the work we do for peace is worthwhile? What in fact are the results of our work for the people on whose behalf or with whom we work?

It is primarily targeted at humanitarian organisations but is also applicable to development cooperation and peacebuilding.; Project level; Aid is not neutral in the midst of conflict. Aid and how it is administered can cause harm or can strengthen peace capacities in the midst of conflicted communities. All aid programmes involve the transfer of resources (food shelter water health care training etc.) into a resource-scarce environment. Where people are in conflict these resources represent power and wealth and they become an element of the conflict. Some people attempt to control and use aid resources to support their side of the conflict and to weaken the other side. If they are successful or if aid staff fail to recognise the impact of their programming decisions aid can cause harm. However the transfer of resources and the manner in which staff conduct the programmes can strengthen local capacities for peace build on connectors that bring communities together and reduce the divisions and sources of tensions that can lead to destructive conflict.; To do no harm and to support local capacities for peace requires:; - careful analysis of the context of conflict and the aid programme examining how aid interacts with the conflict and a willingness to create options and redesign programmes to improve its quality; - careful reflection on staff conduct and organisational policies so that the ""implicit ethical messages"" that are sent communicate congruent messages that strengthen local capacities for peace.; - Analyse dividers and sources of tensions between groups: Systems & Institutions; Attitudes & Actions; [Different] Values & Interests; [Different] Experiences; Symbols & Occasions.; - Analyse connectors across subgroups and Local Capacities for Peace: Systems & Institutions; Attitudes & Actions; [Shared] Values & Interests; [Shared] Experiences; Symbols & Occasions.; - Analyse the aid programme: mission mandate headquarters; describe the local programme in terms of why; where; what; when; with whom; by whom and how.; - Analyse the aid programme?s impact on dividers/tensions and connectors / local capacities for peace: is the programme design its activities or its personnel increasing or decreasing dividers / tensions? Is it supporting or undercutting connectors / local capacities for peace?; - Consider options for programming redesign and re-check the impact on dividers / tensions and connectors / local capacities for peace: how can the programme details be redesigned so it will ""Do No Harm"" and strengthen local capacities for peace? Ensure the redesign options avoid negative impacts on the dividers or connectors.; The Do No Harm framework is generally used by a group of practitioners familiar with the context and project. In this sense most data is drawn from the participants. However there are times when information gaps are identified and data is collected from other sources to improve the quality of the analysis.; It does not include explicit conflict and peace indicators. However there are many implicit indicators that can be made explicit through a community-based process of indicator development. Such indicators could include a just distribution of resources creating or strengthening networks of relationships across divisions strengthening good governance the use of participatory processes for decision making supporting traditional or indigenous mechanisms for conflict resolution and reconciliation inclusion of diversity of ethnic or religious groups gender or youth in programme activities and leadership structures.; Limited if conducted in workshop format.; The Do No Harm methodology is widely used among international and increasingly local humanitarian and development organisations. In Germany for example a large group of NGOs has committed themselves to mainstreaming Do No Harm within their operations. While engaged in the early development of the tool in collaboration with CDA World Vision has also moved toward a process of mainstreaming the use of the Do No Harm framework since 2001. To this end workshops training of trainers programme assessments and case studies of the use of the above framework have been undertaken worldwide.; - The Do No Harm framework is an approach that is highly compatible with community-based participatory processes and may in fact help strengthen local capacities for peace in the process of using it.; - The underlying concepts of the Do No Harm framework are relatively easy to grasp (this can be done in a one- to two-day workshop). It is nonetheless a longer process to integrate it into staff perspective in such a way that it becomes a conflict analysis lens for better assessing humanitarian and development work.; - It is descriptive in nature and therefore challenges the users to do their own analysis and apply problem-solving skills to the situation. When used well it can improve the quality of programming lowers the risks to staff and community and lays a solid foundation on which peacebuilding can take place.; - After extensive application of the Do No Harm approach in a variety of contexts a number of international NGOs including World Vision have found that it is very useful in both emergency and development settings.; 1. It is primarily focused on the micro situation so that if used without consideration of the macro context it may create a false sense of security for staff.; 2. It is less suitable for an in-depth analysis of macro-level conflict. Some organisations such as World Vision have thus tried to address the above by combining Do No Harm with other macro conflict analysis tools.; - The Do No Harm framework has proved a very valuable tool for micro conflict analysis in both relief and development contexts.; - It is also regarded as a flexible tool that can be further adapted to the various needs of the organisations applying the Do No Harm framework. For instance World Vision found that the use of case study writing and the use of case studies in training help complement the LCPP framework.; More information on the Do No Harm approach can be found on CDA?s website (http://www.cdainc.com/lcp/index.php).

Individual tools can be applied in a wide range of contexts including development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. It is also used by national governments and donors.; Mainly project level and local conflicts although it is also applicable to country-level analysis.; Conflict is complex dynamic and a part of life. When it is violent it becomes destructive.; Conflict transformation is a holistic and multifaceted process of engaging with conflict. It aims to reduce violence and bring about sustainable justice and peace. It requires work in all spheres at all levels and with all stakeholders.; The handbook contains an easily accessible introductory section on understanding conflict which deals with different ways of making sense of conflict and violence concepts of conflict transformation and the nature of peace processes. A further section is devoted to critical issues in conflict analysis including power culture identity gender and rights. Generally the handbook takes a value-based approach to conflict which is firmly grounded on the principles of active non-violence.; The handbook contains a series of tools for analysing conflict. The aim is to reach a multi-dimensional analysis of the conflict and find entry points for action. An important aspect is the inclusion of stakeholders in the analytical and decision-making process.; - Identify stages of conflict; - Predict future patterns; - Select particular episode for further analysis; This tool identifies the different stages levels and patterns of intensity of a conflict over a specific period of time. It assists in identifying indicators for different stages of conflict and violence. Stages of conflict can be used to represent different perceptions of a conflict.; - Clarify local conflict history; - Help people know and accept each other?s understandings of history; This step provides graphic plotting of key conflict-related and other events against a particular timescale. It also highlights the different perceptions of the parties in the conflict.; - Identify actors issues and relationships; - Identify potential allies and entry points for action; This tool helps visualising relationships between conflict actors (it can also include geographical mapping mapping of issues or power alignments mapping of needs and fears). The power relationships become evident through the relative size of actors in the diagram lines between actors symbolise type of relationship (e.g. alliance conflict over particular issue); - Gain insight into motivations of conflict parties and the structures or systems in place that contribute to the conflict; - Identify the key needs of each party; - Find entry points; For each conflict party drawing an ABC triangle helps to understand the position from which each party is approaching conflict the context within which conflict is taking place and identifies key needs.; - Move beyond public positions of each party; - Prepare for facilitation mediation or problem solving interventions; For each conflict party an ?onion? of three concentric circles is drawn. These represent from inside to outside needs (?what we must have?) interests (?what we really want?) and positions (?what we say we want?). It helps identify common ground between groups as basis for further discussions.; - Relates causes and effects to each other and helps to focus interventions; - Facilitates decision making on work priorities; A tree symbolises the core problem of the conflict (trunk) its underlying causes (roots) and effects (branches). It helps reaching agreement in groups on the core problem to be addressed and shows the links between the underlying causes and the effects.; - Clarify negative and positive forces that are working for or against the continuation of violent conflict; - Develop strategies for reducing/eliminating the negative and building on positive forces; It helps provide a visual analysis of positive and negative factors influencing a desired change or plan of action. Positive and negative forces are listed in parallel columns with arrows symbolising their relative strength.; - Find ways to weaken or remove factors supporting a negative situation; Upside-down triangle symbolises a (negative) situation which is upheld by ?pillars? representing the forces maintaining this situation. This step increases understanding of structures sustaining an undesirable situation.; Find right approaches for working at different levels; - Position own work; - Identify potential allies; Two to three levelled pyramids show stakeholders at different levels of the conflict (e.g. top middle grass roots). It helps identify key actors/leadership and links between levels.; Most tools are best used during a workshop or community meeting or within a team. Users can select and combine tools according to their specific needs. Most tools are more effective when used with the active involvement of communities and are designed to deepen their understanding of conflict issues. They need to be used with sensitivity to local circumstances.; Refer to individual tools.; None except a familiarity with the tools.; The RTC approach is used extensively in countries in situations of crisis or in post-settlement peacebuilding both by external interveners and by those taking action for change in their own situations. They have been and are being applied in a wide variety of contexts from local government offices in the UK through international NGOs such as World Vision and Oxfam (West India) to pastoralist communities in Northeastern Kenya.; - Using and developing the tools assist people to express their perspectives and understanding of the situation as all perspectives are seen as valuable. The debate is focused on the issue rather than the individuals. This gives a more complete picture to all involved and clarifies the understanding of all.; - It is important to use some or indeed all of the tools together as a package in order to gain full and nuanced understanding of complex conflict situations.; - Adaptation of the tools to make them more familiar to participants is helpful. For example in parts of Kenya the Conflict Stages diagram is referred to as the ?camel?s hump?.; Analysis is not a one-off activity. Because conflict violence and peace are dynamic analysis needs to be regularly updated.; Some reports can be obtained on application from Responding to Conflict and from various peace networks globally such as ACTION for Conflict Transformation Coalition for Peace in Africa (COPA - South and East Africa) Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU - Afghanistan) and West African Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP).; Responding to Conflict Tel. 44 121 415 5641 Fax 44 121 415 4119 E?mail: enquiries@respond.org Website:www.respond.org,,,,

It is also useful for staff involved in planning and design of development or advocacy programmes in countries experiencing instability.; Levels of application Country and regional levels.; Conceptual assumptions 1. ""Turbulent Contexts"" Refers to what the humanitarian sector is calling Situations of Chronic Political Instability (SCPI).This term expands the notion of ""complex humanitarian emergency"" to reflect the long-term cyclical and political nature of many of these contexts. It covers phenomena such as cyclical conflict violence against civilians political unrest extreme polarisation of wealth natural disasters over a number of years population displacement and the need for humanitarian assistance. The emphasis is on the chronic and political nature of these contexts.; 2. MSTC Tools These tools are based on recent research on the economy of war but do not oppose ""greed"" and ""grievance"". Rather the methodology aims at capturing both the economic agendas in war and the social dynamics (e.g. around class gender identity history belief systems) leading to violence. The MSTC analysis uses specially designed practical tools to peel away the political economic and socio-historic layers of complex conflicts.; MSTC was designed to dovetail with the Do No Harm approach. It provides for detailed contextual information at the meso- and macro-level on which Do No Harm can then build.; Main steps and suggested process MSTC analysis provides five tools to answer the following key questions:; What phases has the context moved through? (Rapid Historical Phase Analysis) What are the symptoms of instability? (Symptoms of Instability Analysis) What kinds of actors are at play in the growing instability? (Actor Characteristics Analysis) What struggles over resources and power have played a role in the growing instability? (Political Economy of Instability Analysis) What resentment and stereotypes have played a role in the growing instability? (Inter-group Relationship Analysis) There are two further tools one to synthesise the analysis (SCPI Mapping) and the other to outline possible future scenarios (Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis).; Other tools are also available in the annex including the iceberg method inspired by the UN Early Warning and Preventive Measures methodology (see Survey of conflict causes as explained in tool 10) that can be used to complement the ?Symptoms of Instability Analysis? in order to identify the structural causes that lie behind the immediate causes identified within the MSTC process.; Guiding questions / indicators Refer to individual tools.; Required resources Variable as modules can be combined in different ways.; Current applications It has recently been applied by World Vision Sudan and will be undertaken in Kosovo and Uganda (planned for July / August 2003). There are also plans to use these tools combined with other tried and tested tools for an inter-agency analysis of Iraq. Key World Vision humanitarian policy and programme staff have been exposed to it. Lessons learnt Lessons learnt are yet to be gathered as it is still early in the test stage. It is nonetheless planned that key practitioners involved in the test runs will be brought together by the end of 2004 for the review and revision of the tools.; However key lessons learnt so far include:; - the need for flexibility in the choice of tools used - the need for sensitivity and confidentiality in the dissemination of findings - the usefulness of the tools for strategic planning in general - the need to consider simplifying the tools.; Commentary on the tool The tool is still in its infancy and yet to be fully tested but early indications are that it is very useful for conflict-sensitive programming (emergency or longer-term development) in areas where macro-level analysis has been neglected. It is also useful for the analysis of ""clusters of countries"" i.e. regions where causal factors are cross-border.; Available reports Reports of MSTC analysis findings for the above countries are not available owing to sensitivities.; Contact details World Vision International Siobhan Calthrop Policy & Advocacy Capacity Building Co-ordinator E?mail:siobhan_calthrop@wvi.org",,,,

It offers a set of simple interrogative tools that help staff think more deeply and effectively about the impacts of their work and taking responsibility for both positive and negative impacts. It also provides a framework for monitoring potential negative or unintended impacts as well as ways to mitigate these.; NGO project managers and other field staff and consultants working in the areas of development and humanitarian assistance. The methodology may also be of interest to national government officials and possibly donors.; Project level although the concepts could be applied at other levels as well.; CARE?s human rights-based approach to relief and development presupposes that all people are entitled to certain minimum conditions of living with dignity (human rights). Relief and development organisations aim to help people achieve these conditions thereby acknowledging their human responsibility to do so. This implies they take responsibility for the human rights impact of their work - whether positive or negative. Human rights are therefore the central criteria for analysing the overall impact of a project.; The methodology is based on three categories of human rights and impacts:; - political rights and impacts (e.g. right to equality and recognition before the law right to a fair trial freedom of thought and expression right to association and political participation); - security rights and impacts (e.g. right to life liberty security of person movement freedom from torture forced displacement degrading treatment sexual assault arbitrary arrest); - economic social and cultural rights and impacts (e.g. livelihood security nurtition food security water health education clean environment shelter participation in one's culture).; The Benefits / Harms Handbook contains tools for situation analysis (profile tools) impact assessment (impact tools) and project (re)design (decision tools). In particular:; -profile tools help users gain a more comprehensive understanding of the contexts in which they work; - impact tools help users think about the unintended impacts of their work; - decision tools help users work through difficult decisions when there is a real danger of harming people with an intervention.; The handbook assumes that most of the information required to answer the tools' questions is already available from the organisation?s field staff. Further information can be gathered from individuals familiar with the local situation who are invited for consultation. If the organisation has been working in the area for some time already it is recommended to hold a workshop inviting middle-level and field staff as well as local experts. For assessing a new project the questions in the tools may be put to the local community in a sensitive way.; The profile impact and decision tools are organised according to the three categories of human rights namely: political security and economic social and cultural rights.; In addition the profile tool also focuses on rights responsibilities and underlying causes in order to help users think about the underlying causes of any human rights problem. To this end consideration is given to the actions attitudes and artifices (e.g. systems and structures) that cause the rights problem.; Depends on the required research. A few hours talking through the profile tools with local staff are considered enough in emergency situations. Otherwise workshops with field staff decision makers and possibly additional experts are recommended.; Projects in East Africa must conduct a benefits / harms analysis before starting implementation. The intention is twofold:; - to conduct such an analysis prior to implementation; - to ensure that the benefits/harms thinking also pervades the project implementation monitoring and evaluation.; It is not possible to design a totally ?harm-free? project upfront so that equal emphasis needs to be placed on the follow up in the form of an ongoing benefits / harms analysis during the project implementation and the identification of ways to mitigate potential negative impacts.; The benefits / harms tools themselves are fairly straightforward to use and capacity can be built quickly.

If they make the wrong decisions on investment employment community relations environmental protection and security arrangements they can exacerbate the tensions that produce conflict. But if they make the right decisions they can help a country turn its back on conflict and move towards lasting peace.; Companies in the extractive industries are on the front lines. Time and again in recent years the exploitation of natural resources such as oil timber and diamonds has fuelled conflict and generated corruption exacting a heavy toll in lives and undermining faith in public administration. All too often local populations have been excluded from discussions about the control of natural resources and have seen few or no tangible benefits from activities carried out in their communities. This leads to resentment social discord and even violence.; Enlightened self-interest should steer businesses towards playing an active role in promoting transparency and accountability in managing the extraction and sale of natural resources. Increasingly a company's reputation depends not only on what product or service it provides but also on how it does so. By adopting a proactive approach companies can reduce operational risks promote stability and improve relations with the communities in which they operate. Indeed a company's ?bottom-line' can no longer be separated from peace development and the other goals of the United Nations.; This publication offers practical suggestions for companies in the extractive industries seeking to adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to their operations. It provides ideas for fostering better relationships with stakeholders. And it gives examples of good practices that I hope will serve as an inspiration to companies operating in violent or volatile environments. I welcome this contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to promote responsible corporate citizenship and universal principles and I hope it reaches the wide global audience it deserves.,,,,

The publication includes some lessons for development agencies on supporting a positive role for business in conflict zones.; Conflict-Sensitive Business Practice: Guidance for Extractive Industries (CSBP) is a set of tools to help multinational companies concerned with improving their impact on host countries to begin thinking more creatively about understanding and minimising conflict risk and actively contributing to peace.; The following screening tools act as a departure point for conflict-sensitive business practices. They provide analysis of the risk of conflict or conflict-escalation through research of the conditions associated with conflict.; M-CRIA is designed to bridge the gap in normal political and financial risk assessment in analysing conflict risk. The process consists of a series of steps that involve substantial and continuous consultation with local representatives and the production of a conflict analysis report that must be constantly revised as circumstances change.; The guiding principle is consideration of the conflict in and of itself and not in a company or project context. Stakeholder engagement conducted as a two-way dialogue not an information gathering mission for the company is a central aspect of the process and ensures that host communities have a vested interest in the success of the project from the outset.; For more information see Section 3: M-CRIA of CSBP.; P-CRIA fills the same gaps as M-CRIA on a local or project level. It is a mechanism for a company to generate a ?social licence to operate' and as such is the crux of operationalising conflict-sensitive business practices.; Methodology for this stage of conflict-sensitive business practice includes participatory analysis particularly for those residing in areas impacted by the project; good communication and strong local relationships; and shared decision-making.; The company is required to go through a number of key steps to ensure successful implementation of P-CRIA.

Many frameworks or conflict analysis tools have already been established which an organisation may use to research and understand these indicators. As well a needs-assessment framework - such as a sustainable livelihoods assessment a participatory poverty assessment a participatory rural appraisal a good governance assessment or a gender analysis can contribute and be complimented by conflict analyses. Alternatively they may be integrated to form a more robust societal analysis.; Further information on conducting a conflict analysis can be found in Chapter 2 of the Resource Pack.; The following checklist poses a number of questions that can help organisations think about the type of conflict analysis tool they need:; Purpose; - Does the tool provide the information you need for your work?; - Is the proposed process of conflict analysis consistent with your aims?; Assumptions; - Do you share the tool's specific understanding of conflict?; - Does this perspective correspond to the mandate and values of your organisation?; Methodology; - Does the proposed methodology match the purpose of the analysis?; - Does the proposed methodology agree with the ways of working of your organisation?; - How long does it take to gain results?; Resource implications; - What are the resource implications of the selected tool (staff time travel seminar costs facilities data management)?; - Is your organisation able to allocate the required resources?; Availability; - Is this tool available at the time and cost that suit you?; - Can full documentation be accessed?,,,,
,20,publications crawler,publications crawler,20,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/node/77,Mainstreaming Conflict Sensitivity,,,,,The most effective way to build an institution's capacity is to try to integrate it across programmes. Conflict needs to be factored into all aspects from programme assessment to design to implementation and monitoring so that the intended and unintended consequences across multiple sectors may be examined. There is no single recipe for how to best mainstream a conflict-sensitive approach as it varies depending on the particular organisation its needs and how it operates in the field.; Some organisations have developed stand-alone conflict or peace units that strive to build the capacity of the organisation to conduct and operate in a conflict-sensitive manner. These efforts are most effective when the unit is well connected and linked to the rest of the organisation and has institutional support. Otherwise it risks becoming marginalised and having peacebuilding being seen as an isolated sector.; Experience shows that for conflict sensitivity to have maximum impact five organisational factors need to be addressed namely:; - institutional commitment; - willingness to make changes in organisational culture and institutional structures; - support for capacity development; - conducive external relationships; - accountability mechanisms; Ideally an organisation will undertake a comprehensive strategy to implement a conflict- sensitive approach throughout its programming and operations. However depending on the needs and availability of resources some organisations may start by developing the skills of a few staff members. They in turn can begin implementing the approach on a limited number of projects and slowly seek to promote it to others in the organisation. It may also be effective as an initial step to rely on expert consultants although in the long-term if efforts are to be effective they must be internalised and there must be organisational support.,,,,
,21,publications crawler,publications crawler,21,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/node/76,Planning and Programming,,,,,Conflict sensitivity is not merely about conducting a conflict analysis or checking off a box before undertaking a programme. It is about recognising the relationship between how programmes can affect conflict and the wider context and how in turn the context can affect programming.; In addition to understanding the larger conflict context an organisation should be conflict-sensitive at the project and programme level. Every activity is part of the conflict dynamic and thus has the potential to negatively or positively affect the conflict and larger context. Therefore adapting a conflict-sensitive approach is essential to projects and programmes that directly address conflict as well as those that seek simply to avoid indirectly exacerbating it.; To date there is no unified terminology for conflict-sensitive programme planning. Terms in use include Conflict Analysis at the programme or project level and Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment (PCIA). In general such approaches study how a particular intervention might affect the conflict either positively or negatively and how the conflict or context might affect the intervention.; Because of the dynamic and changing nature of conflict the analysis should be ongoing. For this reason some eschew terms such as Conflict Analysis or PCIA. The Field Diplomacy Initiative for example refers to Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment Systems (PCIAS) in order to emphasise that it is an 'integrated system approach into the routine planning monitoring and implementation of their interventions'.,,,,

,23,publications crawler,publications crawler,23,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/node/75,Conflict Analysis,,,,,Conflict analysis is at the core of conflict-sensitive programming. It is the systematic study of the profile causes actors and dynamics of a conflict. Conflict analysis can be carried out at various levels (e.g. local regional national etc.) and seeks to establish the links between these levels.; It includes:; - In-depth analysis of the conflict environment (actors profile causes and dynamics) informed by the perspectives of the communities themselves;; - On-going mapping and (re)analysis of the conflict as the programme unfolds. This includes awareness of links among community national regional and international levels of conflict; and; - Ensuring that the knowledge gained from this analysis informs the different steps of the programme from planning to implementation monitoring and evaluation. (Lange M. Building Institutional Capacity for Conflict-Sensitive Practice); Many tools exist for conducting a conflict analysis. As each context is different no one tool can be prescribed. The tools section of this website outlines several options and offers guidance on how to select a conflict analysis tool.,,,,

It cannot prevent conflict from continuing or restarting but it can be the first opportunity for war or violence affected communities to experience an alternative to conflict as the sole basis for their relationship with opposing groups.; In the context of post-conflict recovery where resources are scarce and violence is endemic the selective allocation of aid can be a powerful reason for disagreement and conflict between those who receive assistance and those who do not. How National Society and Federation programmes use and distribute resources will have an impact (positive or negative; direct or indirect) on the context in which they are working. Even if their approach is totally neutral and impartial the perception of those who are excluded from assistance may be completely different.; Where aid organisations particularly local Red Cross and Red Crescent can make a difference is in the planning and implementation of their own aid programmes. Humanitarian aid can and should promote long-term recovery and reconciliation within and between communities - at a very minimum it should never become a pretext for or cause of conflict or tension between groups.; 1. Analyse the context; - Identify dividers within the categories of systems and institutions; attitudes and actions; values and interests; experiences; and symbols and occasions.; - Identify connectors within the categories of systems and institutions; attitudes and actions; values and interests; experiences; and symbols and occasions.; 2. Describe the aid programme; - Describe in details the planned / undertaken activities in terms of why where what when with whom by whom and how.; - Analyse important institutional issues such as: mandate/influence in programme implementation; headquarters role/influence in programme implementation; fundraising/influence in programme implementation.; 3. Identify the impacts; - Will the planned action reinforce a connector or weaken one? Will it aggravate a tension or lessen one?; - Use some specific questions as guidance for example:; --- is our aid provoking theft thus diverting resources towards the potential conflict?; --- is our aid affecting the local markets thus distorting the local economy?; --- are our distributions exacerbating divisions within the population?; --- is our aid substituting controlling authorities' responsibilities thus allowing further resources to be invested in the potential conflict?; --- are we through our aid legitimising local supporters of the potential conflict or those who want reconciliation?; 4. Find alternative options; For each impact identified (positive or negative) as a side effect of the planned programme:; - brainstorm programme options that will decrease negative effects and increase positive ones;; - check the options for their impact on the other connectors and dividers.; 5. Repeat the analysis; As often as the context demands and as often as the project cycle indicates.; See the section above; Required resources and time will depend on the scope and context of the assessment. A training kit with different modules was created to introduce the Better Programming Initiative (BPI) in 90 minutes one day or three days session. A BPI training of trainers workshop (9 days) was also developed.; Initially undertaken in Colombia Liberia Nigeria Bangladesh Tajikistan and Kosovo. In order to contribute to the institutionalisation of the BPI methodology within National Societies the International Federation is training National Society staff and delegates as BPI trainers and integrating this tool within other Federation planning and assessment tools.; National Societies and Federation delegations are using the tool to assess the positive or negative impact of their projects especially in post-conflict situations and in countries recovering from violence.; Well-planned aid programmes can ease suffering and reduce vulnerability providing a genuine foundation for recovery. However experience in all six countries has shown that a thorough needs assessment is not enough unless it is accompanied by an in-depth analysis and understanding of the context at the level of the intervention.; Rehabilitation programming by humanitarian aid organisations including the International Federation is increasingly used to support recovery and transition plans which form part of an overall political settlement. Evidence from several of the countries in which the BPI was piloted suggests that when the Federation supports National Societies engaged in rehabilitation programs linked to political settlements it needs to examine carefully the conditions under which it will be expected to work. Inevitably there are groups who may oppose the settlement and the recovery plan that provides aid and resources to their former enemies. The population may also be sensitive to the type of assistance provided and the proportion in which it is allocated.; Throughout the BPI testing phase National Societies and delegation staff found that the most common way in which they may contribute to fuel tension is through the selection beneficiaries without undertaking a thorough analysis of the needs of all groups affected by the conflict.; Although this methodology initially focused on conflict and post-conflict situations it has now been recognised that it may also be useful in other contexts. There are also concrete and successful examples of the BPI methodology used to analyse the impact of our National Societies? institutional capacities as well as the impact of our Disaster Response Disaster Preparedness and Development projects.; The experience also shows that BPI can be an element of analysis that supports the linkage between aid or relief and longer-term recovery and development. As a planning and impact assessment methodology and training initiative BPI may also be a capacity-building mechanism.; In 2003 the Federation was scheduled to publish 'Aid: Supporting or Undermining Recovery? Lessons from the Better Programming Initiative' containing the lessons learnt in six countries (Colombia Liberia Nigeria Bangladesh Tajikistan and Kosovo).; Inigo Barrena Disaster Preparedness and Policy Department International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Tel: +41 22 730 4452 Fax: +41 22 733 0395 E-mail: inigo.barrena@ifrc.org Website: http://www.ifrc.org/,,,,

If so please consider whether other phases are relevant.; - are the indicators you selected important both in terms of facts and perceptions?; - do the indicators selected reflect the concerns of different sectors of the population (women elderly poor children rich etc.)?; Step 4: Stakeholder analysis; The same guiding questions as above plus the following:; - peace agendas: what visions of peace do the stakeholders have? What kind of peace do they want? What are the main elements of their peace agendas (land reform national autonomy)?; - capacities: what capacities do the stakeholders have to support conflict prevention and peacebuilding or to otherwise affect it?; - implications for peacebuilding: strategic conclusions: what implications does this analysis have for pursuing structural stability and peacebuilding?; Step 5: Scenarios and objectives; The guiding questions are:; - what are trends in key conflict indicators/synergies peace indicators and stakeholder dynamics?; - what is your judgement about best/middle/worst-case scenarios when considering the overall (conflict peace stakeholder) picture?; - what optimal and contingency objectives can you draw from the best and worst case (respectively) scenarios?; Step 6: Strategic issues and choices; The guiding questions are:; - in view of the full analysis review identified conflict synergies. Are they complete?; - assess the initiatives of other agencies and the capacity and comparative advantage of one?s own agency in the different fields (governance economic socio-cultural and security).; - in view of the previous questions are key peacebuilding gaps adequately defined?; - specifically look at your capacity in different fields (political economic social security) at all levels (local regional and international). What can be mobilised to impact on conflict synergies and peacebuilding gaps?; Step 7: Peacebuilding recommendations; Once the recommendations have been identified they need to be looked at in terms of:; - the overall peacebuilding objectives; - coherence of the strategy; - who should be involved; The framework is designed to be most useful when used in a workshop setting and so resources would be required to organise a workshop.; Three workshops have been held to apply this framework: in Sierra Leone the Philippines and the DRC.; 1. Although systematised thinking is required for good conflict analysis and strategy development the constantly changing nature of conflict is not easily captured in tables and boxes. The use of supplementary devices to enhance understanding (e.g. conflict trees) is therefore essential.; 2. The diagnostic tool is just that - it does not enable good analysis if its users lack a good understanding of the conflict under study or analytical skills.; 3. The tool needs to be adapted for use by different types of actors e.g. international development agencies with programmed development interventions or local NGOs engaging in various activities.; 4. In order to ensure high quality analysis and a good strategy the tool should be applied in a workshop process that brings together key (constructive) stakeholders.; None; The Compendium of Operational Tools can also be consulted at www.acdi-cida.gc/peace for operational tools best practices and lessons learned.; Chief Peacebuilding Unit; E?mail: mailto:mpeace_building@acdi-cida.gc.ca,,,,

The methodology can also be used for regions or sub-regions and be modified for other thematic focuses (e.g. migration health human rights etc.).; The objective of FAST is the recognition of impending or potential crisis situations for the purpose of early action and the prevention of violent conflict. FAST aims to enhance the ability of political decision makers to identify critical developments in a timely manner in order to formulate coherent political strategies to prevent or limit destructive effects of violent conflicts.; FAST uses a comprehensive combination of qualitative and quantitative analytical methods to produce risk assessments. The concept that forms the foundation of the FAST early warning methodology is event data analysis - i.e. the ongoing information collection of daily events and its quantitative analysis. This is supplemented by the qualitative analysis provided by international experts as well as the in-house analysis carried out by the desk officers.; The conflict analysis is carried out along two principles:; - The qualitative conflict analysis of a given country is conducted by applying the FAST analytical framework which aims to determine root proximate and intervening factors that can lead to the outbreak of a violent conflict or shape an existing conflict.; - The quantitative analysis follows the logic of event data analysis meaning the ongoing collection of daily events that are relevant for our focus of increasing/decreasing stability in a country. This data set is then analysed statistically and the results are displayed in graphs. The information collection is carried out by local information networks on the ground in order to have a set of data that is independent from Western newswires but also to gain higher frequency and dispersion throughout the country.; The analytical framework looks at root and proximate causes as well as intervening factors along a timeline. Thereby various indicators are identified following a set of topics including historic political / institutional economic societal / socio demographic ecological and international issues. These indicators however have to be applied in a flexible manner and need to be adjusted according to the context.; The indicators that are identified in the analytical framework are used for the ongoing monitoring that is carried out. Besides these issues correlate with the indicators that are used in the quantitative system used by FAST.; Due to the different components of FAST the amount of human resources that is required is as follows:; -desk officers in Bern (each desk officer covers 2-3 countries); -local Information networks (3-5 field monitors in each country as well as one country coordinator); -an expert network to cover all the countries that are monitored by FAST; -statisticians and personnel for quality control.; At present there are 12 employees at the headquarters in Bern.; -FAST currently covers 22 countries in Central Asia South Asia the Balkans the Middle East the Horn of Africa the Great Lakes region and Southern Africa. The coverage can be expanded according to clients? needs.; -The Conflict Early Warning and Response Mechanism (CEWARN) initiated by IGAD has adapted the FAST methodology focusing on cross-border pastoral conflicts in the IGAD member states.; -Real-time monitoring of 186 event types - conflict / cooperation - using event data analysis; -System can be tailored to meet the end-user?s needs; -Combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis; -The analytical framework tool has proven an effective analysis tool that has also been effectively used at several early warning training workshops.; FAST is an early warning tool based on conflict analysis and not an early response mechanism as the responses to be taken on the basis of the forecasting provided by FAST remain with the end users.; The analytical framework - FAST?s qualitative analysis tool - can easily be applied by other institutions. Besides FAST has used this tool in several training workshops (held in collaboration with the FEWER network) and has received positive response to its application. The framework allows for a comprehensive in-depth analysis of a region / country and gives an excellent overview of the causes and the development of a conflictive environment over time while highlighting positive intervening factors that can be useful for peace-building initiatives.; The complex FAST methodology can be modified and adjusted to different regions and focuses. The set-up and application however is cost-intensive due to the different components needed for information collection and quality control analysis and report writing. Nevertheless the advantage of having local networks for information collection and data that is independent from Western newswires clearly outweighs the higher overall costs.; The quarterly risk assessments are published on the FAST website (www.swisspeace.org/fast/); Swisspeace Tel.: +41 (0) 31 330 12 12 E?mail: fast@swisspeace.ch Website: www.swisspeace.org/fast/,,,,

Trends and opportunities; How does the conflict presently develop? What factors encourage violence what factors contribute to peace? Are there peace initiatives? At what level? What have they achieved? How can linkages between micro-level activities and macro-level processes be achieved?; B. Project planning; 1. Capacity analysis (own organisation and partners); Why do we want to work on conflict? What is our mandate? Do partners and beneficiaries wish such an engagement? Do we have the necessary skills knowledge resources and networks to work on conflict? How can we build them? How would this affect our other activities in the area?; 2. Goal analysis; -What are the key entry points for working on the conflict? -What are the beneficiaries/partners' priorities? -What are our priorities? -What is our comparative advantage?; 3. Strategy development; -Do we have a coherent strategy to address the priority issues identified above? -Do we have the minimum political legal and security requirements to do this work? -Do we have sufficient political support (local national)? -Is the timing appropriate? Is there a window of opportunity? -Is the initiative sustainable?; 4. Risk assessment; Is there a possibility that the initiative directly or indirectly intentionally or unintentionally:; -contributes to social and economic polarisation? -reinforces undemocratic political structures? -weakens civil society and undermines political participation? -compromises local mediators or conflict management structures? -provides opportunities for hate propaganda or censorship?; 5. Peace and conflict indicators; To cover the security political economic social and external dimensions of conflict.; Guiding questions / indicators Each analytical step contains a set of guiding questions which help the user to build an understanding of the conflict and prepare conflict-sensitive action. The key guiding questions are:; A. Conflict analysis -Conflict profile -Stakeholder analysis -Causes of conflict -Trends and opportunities; B.

It is mainly development focused.; USAID desk officers implementing partners mission staff US embassy staff and other US government participants.; Country / national regional and sectoral levels (e.g. democracy and governance health natural resource management); The framework aims to pull together the best research available on the causes of conflict and focuses on the way that the different variables interact. It does not aim to make predictions. It also does not explicitly weight variables although it identifies a few categories of key causes of conflict namely:; - ethnic and religious divisions; - economic causes of conflict; - environment and conflict; - population migration and urbanisation; - institutional causes of conflict.; - Desk study on the country context and the main causes of conflict.; - Discussions with other US agencies (e.g. State Department Department of Justice etc.) on the planned engagement for that country and the planned conflict assessment.; - Assessment team goes to the country for a three to four week visit. This visit generally includes a workshop with the mission staff and partner organisations (i.e. partner organisations working on conflict as well as from different sectors). The country visit leads to a conflict mapping which is being compared to existing programmes to assess whether they addressing the conflict causes.; - The outcome of the assessment is a report with recommendations on how to address the conflict causes through development programmes. The recommendations focus specifically on examining the in-country organisational capacity to address the causes of conflict that have been identified.; - The mission then takes forward the recommendations (with support from the original assessment team) within their programming strategy.; After the desk study has been conducted specific sectoral themes generally emerge as key conflict causes (e.g. competition for access to natural resources) and a multi-sectoral team will be pulled together accordingly. The team will normally consist of no more than five people including sectoral specialists who can be either from the head office or in-country consultants (the number of people from head office is usually restricted to one or two people). The team spends about three to four weeks in-country working with the mission staff.; The methodology suggests some broad guiding questions in order to stimulate thinking on the interaction of different issues and tensions. They centre on the need to first establish the variety of causes that interact and overlap and then to move into the more detailed analysis of what these causes are and the dynamics between them. This analysis focuses on four categories of the causes of internal conflict and specifies a number of key issues under each category:; 1. root causes (greed and grievance): including ethnic and religious divisions; economic causes of conflict; environment and conflict; population migration and urbanisation; and the interaction between different root causes and conflict; 2. causes that facilitate the mobilisation and expansion of violence (access to conflict resources): organisations and collective action; financial and human resources; conflict resources and widespread violence; 3. causes at the level of institutional capacity and response: democracy and autocracy; political transitions and partial democracies; weak states shadow states and state failure; state capacity political leadership and conflict; 4. regional and international causes/forces: globalisation war economies and transnational networks; bad neighbourhoods.; In addition to the categories and principles outlined above the idea of ?windows of vulnerability? is also introduced which indicates the moments when particular events (e.g. elections riots assassinations etc.) can trigger the outbreak of full-scale violence.; The resources required relate to the time spent on the desk study before the in-country visit the in-country visit itself and the follow-up support after the visit. In total the entire process takes around two months.; This methodology has been applied in about 18 countries to date in Africa the Middle East the Caucasus Latin America Asia / Near East and the NIS. USAID also participated in the multi-donor assessment that was conducted in Nigeria (together with DFID the World Bank and UNDP).; - Workshops were found to be a useful format for the in-country assessment work.; - Using local consultants has been very valuable but one needs to carefully select them bearing in mind their own political opinions and affiliations. In some cases it has been impossible to use local consultants due to such sensitivities or the fact that they may be put at risk through their involvement in the assessment.; - The importance of having a team composed of specialists from different sectors has been proven so as to broaden it beyond people usually working only on conflict.; - Similarly integrated multi-sectoral programming is important in order to effectively address the confluence of the different conflict causes and dynamics.; - The ultimate objective of the assessment is to enable the mission to adjust their programming in order to make a difference to the conflict dynamics in-country. The close involvement and buy-in from the mission staff is therefore critical to ensure that implementation takes place.; - In-country good co-operation with the US Embassies has proven very useful.; - After producing the assessment report with its recommendations it is crucial to follow up and ensure that the findings are incorporated into the programme strategies in country.; - It has proved fairly easy to convince mission staff of the link between conflict and their programming but the challenge has been how to then design and implement more conflict-sensitive programmes. With this in mind USAID has started developing a menu of options / examples for different types of programmes on different sectors such as for instance how to design a programme for conflict-sensitive water management or youth engagement.; This methodology has been very successful at establishing the analysis of what conflict causes are and how they link to sector programming. The challenge is now to ensure that this realisation is implemented through appropriate programme design and implementation.; The country reports are not available publicly and the conflict assessment framework methodology is not available yet although it is envisaged that it will eventually be available on the USAID website.; Adam Reisman Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation USAID Tel: +1 202 661 5862 E?mail: mailto:Mareisman@dis.cdie.org Website: http://www.usaid.gov/,,,,

In order for the MNE Guidelines to meet their potential there needs to be a clarification regarding operations in conflict zones and implementations also need to be strengthened.; The Paper therefore gives the following recommendations:; [Summary Source: Eldis],http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/Promoting_Conflict_Prevention.pdf,,,Promoting_Conflict_Prevention.pdf

It is most relevant to diplomatic and development actors; Country and regional levels.; N / A; The checklist is filled in by European Commission desk officers and delegation staff on the basis of their general knowledge of the country and other open sources of information. Subsequent statistical analysis allows the addition of other quantitative data (e.g. UNDP Human Development Index) and the clustering of results according to category.; The checklist uses the following root causes of conflict / early warning indicators:; 1. legitimacy of the state: are there proper checks and balances in the political system? How inclusive is the political/administrative power? What is the overall level of respect for national authorities? Is corruption widespread?; 2. rule of law: how strong is the judicial system? Does unlawful state violence exist? Does civilian power control security forces? Does organised crime undermine the country?s stability?; 3. respect for fundamental rights: are civil and political freedoms respected? Are religious and cultural rights respected? Are other basic human rights respected?; 4. civil society and media: can civil society operate freely and efficiently? How independent and professional are the media?; 5. relations between communities and dispute-solving mechanisms: how good are relations between identity groups? Does the state arbitrate over tensions and disputes between communities? Are there uncontrolled flows of migrants/refugees?; 6. sound economic management: how robust is the economy? Is the policy framework conducive to macro-economic stability? How sustainable is the state?s environmental policy?; 7. social and regional inequalities: how are social welfare policies addressed? How are social inequalities tackled? How are regional disparities tackled?; 8. geopolitical situation: how stable is the region?s geopolitical situation? Is the state affected by external threats? Is the state affecting regional stability?; In the original tool each question is further specified by two to four sub-questions.; Mainly desk-based tool limited resources required.; - In preparation for the January 2002 debate on potential conflict issues conflict assessments were carried out by Commission desk officers and EC delegations for more than 120 countries on the basis of the indicators. The objectives were:; ---to increase awareness within the EU decision-making forums of the problems of those countries/regions with the highest assessed risk of an outbreak continuation or re-emergence of conflict; ---to heighten efforts to ensure that EU policies (and in particular EC ones) contribute to conflict prevention/resolution.; Countries receiving highest scores were drawn to the attention of the General Affairs Council through a confidential ?watch list?. The watch list is subject to constant revision on the basis of the above indicators.; - When drafting the political analysis section of the Commission?s country and regional strategy papers risk factors contained in the checklist are systematically reviewed by the Commission?s geographical services and on the basis of the conflict analysis attention is drawn to conflict prevention focused activities that external aid should target.; - Although the checklist is relatively new generally EC desk officers and delegations are positive about the usefulness of the tool. It is regarded as an important step forward for mainstreaming conflict prevention and addressing structural causes of conflict through EU policies and programmes. In order to streamline the procedure further a web-based platform is under development.; - In order to further improve the efficiency of the checklist the following actions are being considered:; ---a review of the appropriateness of the indicators and the clusters with a view to identifying whether more indicators should be added or whether indicators should be further adapted to specific geographical regions.; ---more specialised training for desk officers and delegations on the root causes checklist - using the checklist requires allocating a rating to each indicator (from 0-4) and thus involves a certain measure of personal perception. The training would help ensure that the results of the analysis can be assessed consistently and comparatively.; ---another possible use for the checklist would be to apply it in the Commission?s interactions with partners (e.g. EU member states international organisations NGOs etc.).; - The checklist exercise needs to be placed in the context of the Communication from the Commission on conflict prevention and the EU programme for the prevention of violent conflicts which highlighted the need to move the timescale for EU action forward becoming progressively more pro-active and less reactive. It also promotes the notion that an early identification of risk factors increases the chances of timely and effective action to address the underlying causes of conflict.; - The checklist is only one of the tools that the Commission has at its disposal for monitoring and early warning. Others include regular reporting from Delegations and desk officers on issues related to the economic and political developments in concerned countries open source information via the Commission's crisis room and ECHO?s disaster monitoring system known as ICONS (Impeding Crisis Online New System).; The checklist for root causes of conflict is available on the EC website (http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/cpcm/cp/list.htm).; Conflict Prevention Unit European Commission External Relations Directorate General Javier Nio Prez Tel: +32 2 2964852 E-mail: javiernino-perez@cec.eu.int; Guy Banim Tel: +32 2 2996049 E-mail: guy.banim@cec.eu.int,,,,

It provides an analytical and action framework which will help plan preliminary responses to early warning.; Diplomatic and development actors mainly desk officers and policy makers in foreign policy and development departments. Indigenous and international NGOs engaged in early warning.; Country level although an adaptation of the methodology to look at local conflicts has also proven useful.; The methodology is designed as a ""quick tool"" which can provide insight into overall trends. It is not meant as a substitute for more sustained conflict analysis monitoring and consultations.; The key assumption is: ""(a) Conflict trends - (b) peace trends +/- (c) stakeholder trends = overall trends?; Conflict analysis consists of four broad steps:; 1. analysis of conflict indicators (root causes proximate causes and conflict triggers in the areas of politics/security economy and socio-culture); 2. analysis of peace indicators (systems processes and tools sustaining peace in a given society in the areas of politics/security economy and socio-culture); 3. stakeholder analysis (agenda/power needs and actions of stakeholders in areas of politics/security economy and socio-culture); In each of these three areas the analyst is asked to establish linkages and synergies between the indicators/stakeholders identified and build three scenarios (best-case status-quo worst-case); 4. summary analysis: using the above formula the predominant trends in the areas of conflict and peace indicators as well as among stakeholders are brought together to determine overall conflict trends. Again three overall scenarios are formulated.; The methodology can be used for a desk study or to facilitate a conflict analysis workshop. Participants mainly draw on their existing knowledge of the conflict little new research is required.; For illustrative purposes the methodology contains an extensive list of conflict and peace indicators for the Caucasus and the Great Lakes Region which were generated during FEWER?s early warning activities.; Modest resources are required for desk study workshop or trainings based on the methodology.; WANEP has been using this methodology internally for their own peacebuilding work as well as training with other actors in most countries in West Africa (Nigeria Niger Ghana Sierra Leone Liberia Senegal Gambia) and ECOWAS. WANEP has developed numerous policy briefs including briefs on Cte d?Ivoire Guinea and Liberia. Policy briefs are targeted broadly at various levels including governments the UN ECOWAS the EU and international NGOs. Their methodology has also been applied in the form of a training of trainers in East Africa.; The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) also asked WANEP to work on the provision of training on conflict methodologies based on the FEWER/WANEP/CCR approach and experiences.; - Good analysis is appreciated by stakeholders including policy makers and allows track 1 at national level to be influenced in positive ways by track 2 peace-building and conflict prevention activities. In Cte d?Ivoire the policy briefs produced by the West Africa Early Warning and Response Network (WARN) impacted on the Makousis and Accra Accords.; - Good analysis is appreciated by stakeholders including policy makers The conflict analysis tool provides a standard tool which facilitates the production of easily-digested policy briefs.; - The tool has served a useful purpose in supporting the engendering of early warning systems in West Africa.; - With the use of this approach good conflict analysis enabled various assessments at various levels from community to national levels. In turn strategic programme planning and intervention processes were well facilitated. These valuable lessons emerged from civil society intervention programmes in Sierra Leone.; - In situations where violence had escalated facilitating a conflict analysis amongst primary and secondary conflict stakeholders brought about clarity in terms of appreciating outstanding issues and working collaboratively to resolve the issues.; - Many conflicts in West Africa thrive on conflict systems that are located across national borders. Conflict analysis has influenced policy making to appreciate regional approaches to conflict prevention rather than limiting these approaches to what appear to be internal conflicts.; Although primarily designed for country level conflict analysis the experience of applying the methodology has shown that in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana conflicts are more localised but with the potential for national destabilisation.

In particular human security refers to the safety for individuals and groups from both:; - violent threats e.g. violent crime gross violations of human rights terrorism etc.; - non-violent threats e.g. environmental degradation illicit drugs economic crises infectious diseases natural disasters.; Establish a shared understanding and broad picture of the country / region under consideration including geography history current events economy political system social structure external issues etc.; Identify and assess key actors who can facilitate or undermine peace and stability in a society in particular from the perspective of:; - their main characteristics; - their interests and underlying needs; - the resources that they currently have and those that they still need or hope to obtain.; Identify possible causes of violent conflict following two main dimensions:; - categorise possible causes of violent conflict in terms of their potential threat to various aspects of human security. These include: governance and political stability social and communal stability economic and resource stability personal security military mobilisation and arms supply external factors; - further distinguish between proximate and structural causes within each human security category.; Consider human rights as a cross-cutting issue and ensure that it is mainstreamed in all human security categories.; Explore the interaction between the structural causes of conflict in order to assess the resulting conflict dynamics and to identify the core issues which preventive action will need to address.; Identify elements of a preventive action strategy in order to address the core issues highlighted through the conflict analysis. This will be based on the formulation of objectives the generation of options for preventive action and the identification of recommended measures through a triage process.; Build a two-track scenario reflecting likely developments resulting from the implementation ""or lack thereof"" of the recommended preventive measures in order to develop a convincing argument on the need to take preventive action.; The above steps are usually introduced through a five-day training workshop that combines plenary and country working groups.; Context specific indicators are developed to measure the impact of the potential preventive action using the SMART principle (i.e. Specific; Measurable; Achievable; Relevant; Time-bound).

The evaluators found a heightened awareness concerning areas of early warning and conflict prevention and a determination to make early warning a cross-cutting issue throughout the UN.; - The course content needs to be continuously reviewed in order to ensure it is in line with new developments emerging in the conflict prevention field.; - The pool of trainers that the United Nations System Staff College currently uses needs to be further expanded.; - Human rights issues need to be integrated better.; - Increased advocacy is needed to reach a larger audience beyond the UN system.; - The EWPM methodology remains time consuming if all steps are followed in an in-depth fashion.; - It does not require extensive financial resources as long as no external facilitator is needed.; - It is a flexible methodology that can be adapted to a large variety of audiences beyond the UN system (e.g. civil society; donor agencies).; All reports of the 34 trainings conducted (1999-2003) as well as the recently completed external evaluation are available on the UN System Staff College website (http://www.unssc.org/).; Svenja Korth Project Officer (EWPM) United Nations System Staff College E?mail: mailto:s.korth@unssc.org/ Website: http://www.unssc.org/",,,,

It mainly addresses foreign policy and development issues.; Country and sectoral levels.; The Conflict and Policy Assessment Framework (CPAF) helps to analyse the conflict or stability sensitivity of countries by assessing the role of a number of specified indicators. The assessment will provide information on indicators that (potentially) have a destabilising effect or can put a country at risk. The use of trend lines per indicator will also emphasise whether certain indicators are areas of persistent difficulty suggesting that more attention could/should have been devoted to these in the past. The assessment will also bring into focus the volatility of the situation and identify indicators and areas on which to focus from the perspective of limiting risks to the sustainability of peace or stability.; Within the framework of the CPAF Clingendael uses the ""Analytical Model of Internal Conflict and State Collapse"" developed by the Fund for Peace (1998) for the conflict assessment part. This model uses indicators of internal conflict and state failure. In this approach internal conflict is caused by state failure not the other way round.; Steps for conflict analysis; 1. Trend analysis (Fund for Peace indicators); 2. Analysis of problem areas (i.e. priority areas for policy response); 3. Conflict analysis paper (to establish response-oriented warnings).; Steps for policy analysis; 1. Organisation?s capacity assessment (e.g. mandate operational framework); 2. Toolbox assessment (policy instruments); 3. Policy assessment and lessons learned (of ongoing policies including ex-ante peace and conflict impact assessment); 4. Assessment of the overall security context (partnerships coalitions); 5. Strategic policy paper.; In order to improve the aspect of shared analysis and cooperation with local partners the CPAF works with a workshop format in which all participants (donor desk officers embassy staff and local partners both governmental and non-governmental) are guided through the first three steps of the CPAF. The participants assess the situation of a given country as regards the sustainability of peace and stability by applying the Fund for Peace methodology develop the latest trend line and assess the range of policy options for addressing the areas that are flagged on the basis of the analysis.; The workshop provides the participants with an opportunity to engage in a dialogue on the assessment of the situation as well as the policy options.; During the workshop the participants are divided into several groups to assess the twelve indicator trend lines. The findings are discussed in a plenary session with a moderator. Based on this plenary session the overall trend and problem indicators are established.; In the next step participants are divided into working groups with particular expertise in order to focus discussions and to come up with adequate suggestions for addressing the problems that were identified.; The workshop results in a warning dispatch that highlights the potentially destabilising trends as well as a list of options to address or reverse these trends. The implications for specific donors are discussed in a separate meeting.; On the basis of the Fund for Peace?s analytical model top indicators on the national state level form a central part of the conflict trend analysis. These top indicators are:; -mounting demographic pressure; - massive movement of refugees or internally displaced persons; - legacy of vengeance-seeking group grievance or group paranoia; - chronic and sustained human flight; - uneven economic development along group lines; - sharp and/or severe economic decline; - criminalisation and/or delegitimisation of the state; - progressive deterioration of public services; - suspension or arbitrary application of the rule of law and widespread violation of human rights; - security apparatus operates as a ""state within the state""; - rise of factionalised elites; - intervention of other states or external political and/or economic actors.; Each top indicator is further specified by three to six measures which are linked to ""potential aspects of conflict"" and ""problem areas"".; The main resources required relate to the organisation of the workshop and include preparatory research and workshop material development as well as the costs of travel accommodation etc. for external participants/consultants.; - In 2002 and 2003 the Clingendael Institute has run a number of test cases in Rwanda and Mozambique to further refine the tool. Its findings are used for policy purposes and it is intended to mainstream the completed tool within the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Another application is planned for Kenya at the end of 2003.; - In the case of Rwanda the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs already used the CPAF to feed into its work plan for the country. In the planned Kenyan application the CPAF will be used specifically as a basis for Dutch policy and practice.; - Carrying out the CPAF in a workshop format forced participants to be clear about developments and trends and their potential implications and consequences if not addressed.; - Although participants were generally aware of this the use of ratings was an added value as it gave some sense of urgency that allowed for the visualisation of positive or negative trends over time. The ratings were explained by using examples thus making them more concrete.; - In terms of policy it became clear that some of the sectoral choices that have been made do not adequately relate to some of the identified trends ?from a conflict prevention perspective this clearly needed improvement. On the other hand the projects and activities that were carried out and planned in the sectors of choice could be focused on conflict prevention.; - It was also clear that the overall political position of the Netherlands Embassy could be more critical in its political dialogue with the host governments.; - The findings were also shared with other agencies (USAID and DFID) and it was found that they coincided. This provided opportunities for joint approaches.; - In Rwanda following this initial application further follow-up is being planned with a view to basing future policies and programmes on the same CPAF analysis.; The tool is currently being used in a field test phase by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It will be adapted to make it more easily applicable in the future. This mainly implies speeding up the analysis and the trend line development. It is considered to be flexible and adaptable and practical in a policy setting. The tool is not addressing the specifics of programmes or activities but mainly focuses on strategic approaches for donors (overall programme development and policy approaches) from the perspective of conflict prevention. Its continued application for the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs is under consideration and will be decided upon in 2003.; The CPAF report can be downloaded from the Clingendael website (www.clingendael.nl/cru).

The conceptual basis for the SCA is the combined use of the following analytical ""lenses"":; -the ""political economy"" approach that focuses on the political and social interests of those engaged in conflict drawing attention to those who may benefit from the continuation of the conflict -analysis of the causes of conflict in terms of ""greed"" (opportunities for accumulation or benefit from conflict) and ""grievance"" (negative reactions of those who are disadvantaged) -combined analysis of structures and actors and how they interact with one another -identification of the different layers/dimensions of the conflict (international regional national and local) -recognition of the dynamic character of conflicts which may mean that root causes of violent conflict change and are reshaped in protracted conflicts. -Main steps and suggested process; The methodology is based on the following three analytical steps:; Within each step the following areas are investigated:; A. Conflict analysis; 1. Structures -Analysis of long-term factors underlying conflict: security political economic social; 2. Actors -Analysis of conflict actors: interests relations capacities peace agendas incentives; 3. Dynamics -Analysis of long-term trends of conflict triggers for increased violence capacities (institutions processes) for managing conflict likely future conflict scenarios; B. Analysis of international responses; 1. International actors -Map interests and policies of international actors: military and security diplomatic trade immigration development -Assess level of coherence -Analyse impacts on conflict dynamics.; 2. Development actors -Map magnitude and focus of development policy/programmes -Analyse development actors' approaches to conflict: in on or around? -Assess capacities to work effectively ""in"" and ""on"" conflict -Assess potential to influence conflict and peace dynamics.; 3. Interactions between development interventions and conflict -Assess impact of conflict on development policy and programmes -Assess impact of development interventions on dynamics of conflict and peace.; C. Developing strategies and options Identify possible strategies in terms of: -developing common donor approaches to better respond to conflict -developing conflict sensitive individual donor approaches -adjusting current activities ? working ""in""or ""on"" conflict developing new initiatives.; The following process (for a donor country assessment) is suggested:; -Desk study -Review of relevant documents from a variety of sources -Interviews with key stakeholders in the donor country. -Field work -Internal consultation with donor staff (development agency embassy) -Stakeholder consultation (possibly series of workshops with range of stakeholders within and outside the capital) -Debriefing workshop with donor staff and small expert group to feed back and discuss results. -Drafting conflict assessment document -Guiding questions / indicators -The tool provides useful examples of sources of conflict and tension conflict actors conflict triggers conflict scenarios donor policy instruments and possible conflict prevention strategies. The examples refer to specific countries; no general lists are provided.; Required resources Suggested composition of a country-level conflict assessment team:; -team leader (18 working days) -international consultant (25 working days includes preparation of final report) -two in-country project consultants (10 working days each) -conflict adviser (10 working days) -social development adviser (10 working days). However this will depend on the context in which the conflict assessment framework will be applied the end users of the analysis and their objectives.; Current applications DFID has applied the conflict assessment methodology to a range of country studies including Nepal Kyrgyzstan Moldova Sri Lanka and states in the Caucasus. There has also been a multi-donor assessment in Nigeria which included DFID on the basis of the SCA framework.; Lessons learnt The following methodological and practical lessons have been learned from applying the Strategic Conflict Assessments (SCAs):; -SCAs have improved the quality of analysis across UK government departments and encouraged a more joined-up approach. -They have provided a framework within which to assess new proposals and have been useful in designing coherent strategic interventions. -there is a need to determine the SCAs' target audiences and purpose in the design phase. A limited audience enables a more critical analysis whereas a wider audience necessitates more sensitivity and potential watering down. If other relevant ministries are involved and have a serious stake in the outcome of the process a strongly worded analysis could limit efforts to engage in subtle diplomatic pressure. -there is a need to be clear about why and when to conduct SCAs; in particular they should be timed to coincide with a natural pause or turning point in the programme cycle or before launching a new programme. composition of the team is a crucial element in its success; it is important to encompass expertise from a number of different areas in order to widen and deepen the quality of the analysis. It is also good to have a combination of external and local consultants. -there is a need to achieve the right balance between contextual analysis and programme design. In this sense it is important to have as wide an analysis as possible so that the complexity of the conflict could be properly understood before converting it into programme ideas. -precise recommendations on what action to take next bring added value to SCAs. They also help overcome the feeling that the process could be an extra burden e.g. describing exactly what response needs to be taken who should be responsible for taking it which NGO to work with and how much funding would be required. -it is essential to have active participation of in-country staff to inform the purpose and approach and a staff member dedicated to the follow-up and implementation of recommendations. -SCAs should be conducted in a timeframe of about six weeks up to two months depending on the depth and scope of the study. A minimum of two weeks for field research and two weeks for the writing-up process is recommended. Reports should be published immediately after the assessment to guarantee timely relevance. -the practical application of the SCA depends on the conflict expertise of the users and whether or not they ""ask the right questions"". Less experienced staff may require induction training and support. (A different approach was followed in the Strategic Conflict Assessment in Nigeria in that an NGO led the process and support came from 4 different donors (including DFID). The lessons learned from that process are therefore different).; Commentary on the tool -The tool presents a very comprehensive form of conflict analysis but with a methodological basis that is designed to be tailored to suit specific contexts and end users. -Some parts of the analysis outputs may become out of date quickly and a higher level strategic assessment may not be appropriate as the basis for designing micro-level projects or sectoral interventions without further specific contextual analysis. It would therefore be ideal to complement the conflict assessment methodology with a lighter tool for more continuous monitoring of the programme and conflict situation. -The tool can be used at any point in the programming cycle and at various points in the conflict cycle in a country (i.e. pre-conflict post-conflict etc.).; Available reports The Strategic Conflict Assessment (Conducting Conflict Assessments: Guidance Notes) is available on the DFID website under the Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (http://www.dfid.gov.uk/). Reports on conflict assessments on Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan as well as a synthesis report on Kyrgyzstan Moldova Nepal and Sri Lanka are also available on the above website.; A ""lessons learned"" report on the Strategic Conflict Assessment in Nigeria (conducted by the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution in the Nigerian Presidency with support from DFID the World Bank USAID and UNDP) is available by contacting the address below.; Contact details Department for International Development Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department 20 Victoria Street London SW1H 0NB E?mail: chadenquiry@dfid.gov.uk Tel: 0044 (0)845 300 4100 Fax: 0044 (0)20 7023 0502",,,,

Current Practice and Ways Forward,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Thumbnail/odi.jpg,,,,Drawing on field research from Haiti Pakistan and Sri Lanka interviews with over 50 humanitarian professionals and a document review of aid agencies and sector-wide guidance and standards this paper maps the current state of conflict-sensitive practice in emergencies. It identifies good practices which can be built upon key gaps and points out practical ways to integrate conflict sensitivity more strategically across the emergency programme cycle.; One of the key conclusions from this study is that there are clear opportunities for synergy between conflict sensitivity integration and the emergency capacity-building initiatives currently ongoing within many agencies. Significant improvements can be achieved through relatively simple steps which complement existing tools standards and efforts to improve programme quality. The paper suggests six minimum standards for conflict sensitive emergency response which if applied would not only help minimize harm and reduce conflict risks but also increase the overall effectiveness of humanitarian response.; This paper published by the Humanitarian Practice Network is based on research commissioned by CARE International UK and CAFOD on behalf of the Conflict Sensitivity Consortium with the participation of World Vision International Peace and Community Action Catholic Relief Services ActionAid International and Plan International.,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/ODI%20HPN%20Paper%20English%20Version.pdf; http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/ODI%20HPN%20Paper%20French%20Version.pdf,http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/ODI HPN Paper English Version.pdf; http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/sites/default/files/ODI HPN Paper French Version.pdf,,ODI HPN Paper English Version.pdf; ODI HPN Paper French Version.pdf

It can also be adapted for use at the (sub) regional level.; The contribution of development organisations such as the World Bank to conflict prevention is regarded as threefold:; - making countries more resilient to the eruption and escalation of violent conflict by strengthening participatory and inclusive social processes and institutions that may help manage conflicts in non-violent ways; - addressing factors related to conflict and determine their links with poverty - sources (including roots) of conflicts; opportunities for groups to engage in violent activities and the consequences of conflict; - determining the factors that can be addressed through World Bank assisted strategies and the modalities through which they can best be managed.; The World Bank's methodology includes two stages namely:; - a screening process aimed to test whether it is (or not) appropriate to undertake a full conflict analysis in the country under consideration. The screening considers a set of nine indicators of potential violence; - a full conflict analysis process on the basis of the Conflict Analysis Framework (CAF).; The following steps are recommended for conducting a CAF-based conflict analysis:; - reinterpretation of existing information on the conflict situation of a country along the lines of the CAF (brief desk study); - workshops with country specialists to cover each of the six CAF categories and analysis of variables along a set of specific dimensions that will help determine a country's overall position relative to conflict; - follow-up studies as needed on issues identified in the workshop and monitoring of issues identified as conflict-sensitive; - stakeholder analysis to identify and examine groups who have the ability to affect political and social change including violence and the main groups who are likely to be affected by such changes; - country consultation with different stakeholder groups as needed; - concluding workshops to discuss integration of the above issues into the poverty reduction strategy country strategy or other country programmes.; CAF can be conducted as a stand-alone analysis or integrated into a more comprehensive macro-social analysis (for more information see www.worldbank.org/socialanalysissourcebook).; - History of conflict; - Income per capita; - Primary commodities exports; - Political instability:; --- Transformation of state structure; --- Breakdown of law and order; - Restricted civil and political rights; - Militarisation of the country; - Active regional conflicts; - Ethnic dominance; - Youth unemployment; Although none of these factors alone is necessary or sufficient to determine the outbreak escalation or resumption of violent conflict they have been found to be statistically highly related to conflict.; Categories of variables; - Social and ethnic relations e.g. social cleavages group identity-building bridging social capital; - Governance and political institutions e.g. stability of political institutions equity of law; - Human rights and security e.g. human rights status militarisation of society role of media; - Economic structure and performance e.g. income disparities income changes; - Environment and natural resources e.g. availability of and access to natural resources; - External factors e.g. regional conflicts role of diasporas.; Desk officers are encouraged to use their knowledge of the country to identify those variables which seem most relevant to the conflict in question.; These variables are analysed according to the following dimensions:; - History / changes: how has the variable developed/changed over a relevant time span?; - Dynamics / trends: what is determining the future path of the variable and how is it likely to develop?; - Public perceptions: public attitudes and biases regarding the variable; - Politicisation: how the variable is used politically by groups and organisations;; - Organisation: the extent to which the variable has led to the establishment of interest organisations and / or influenced political parties and militant organisations; - Link to conflict and intensity: how the variable contributes to conflict and the current level of intensity; - Link to poverty: how the variable relates to poverty.; Based on the analysis of variables desk officers are also encouraged to examine linkages between variables.; - Considerable resources are required to conduct a full CAF including expert workshops stakeholder consultations and the deployment of consultants.; - While a full CAF (desk and field work) may require considerable resources this is not a necessity. It is possible to conduct a CAF via a simpler and less expensive process including two to three-day workshops desk studies etc. It is also possible to adapt CAF to the country context by identifying a few conflict sensitive variables and monitoring them on a regular basis.; CAF is being applied to Venezuela Burundi (in co-operation with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)) Rwanda and Somalia.; A lessons learnt document on the above applications is being planned for the end of 2003.; N/A; The CAF methodology can be obtained at: cpr@worldbank.org.; Per Wam / Shonali Sardesai Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit World Bank E?mail: cpr@worldbank.org Website: www.worldbank.org/conflict,,,,
